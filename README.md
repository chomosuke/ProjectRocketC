# ProjectRocketC
### What is this
This is a side project of some random student studying in unimelb. The thing is on google play so you can potientially download it.

It's a game about a rocket flying in space collecting stars and avoiding planet.

### About the development process
The game was first written in Java until about half way I ported it to Kotlin. Apparently Kotlin is a better language than Java (it is newer and more convenient).

This game was written directly on top of opengl (ie without a game engine) until I realized that I've essentially written a costume game engine. Hence I've decoupled the game engine into it's own GitHub repository: https://github.com/chomosuke/PRCAndroid2DGameEngine. You can check it out if you're also interested in a 2D game engine for android.

### Screenshot of The Game
haha too bad for you there isn't any, if you want to know what the game is like download it on Google Play. Just search up Project Rocket and it should be the first one.
